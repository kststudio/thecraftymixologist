## Description

Chingu is an online program for web developers. For 6 weeks, I will be working with other web developers from around the world to build a project from scratch.

This is a pre-work assignment, to build a project of my choice to be placed in a tier based on my level of expertise. Tier 1  - Front End (beginner), Tier 2 - Front End (intermediate/ advanced), Tier 3 - Full-Stack. This project is to demonstrate my expertise to be considered for Tier 3.
